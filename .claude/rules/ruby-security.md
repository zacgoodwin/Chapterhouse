# Ruby Security

> Source: ECC `rules/ruby/security.md` (affaan-m/ecc).

## Rails Defaults

- Keep CSRF protection enabled for state-changing browser requests.
- Use strong parameters or typed boundary objects before mass assignment.
- Store secrets in Rails credentials, environment variables, or a secret manager. Never commit plaintext keys, tokens, private credentials, or copied `.env` values.

## SQL And Active Record

- Prefer Active Record query APIs and parameterized SQL.
- Never interpolate request, cookie, header, job, or webhook values into SQL strings.
- Scope model callbacks carefully; security-sensitive side effects should be explicit and covered by tests.

## Authentication And Sessions

- Use the Rails 8 authentication generator for simple session auth, or Devise when OAuth, MFA, confirmable, lockable, multi-model auth, or existing Devise conventions are required.
- Rotate sessions after sign-in and privilege changes.
- Protect account recovery flows with expiry, single-use tokens, rate limiting, and audit logging.

## Dependencies

- Run dependency checks when the lockfile changes. Neither gem is in this repo's Gemfile yet, so
  these run one-off until they are added:

```bash
gem exec bundler-audit check --update
gem exec brakeman --no-progress
```

- Review new gems for maintainer activity, native extension risk, transitive dependencies, and whether the same behavior can be implemented with Rails core.

## Web Safety

- Escape template output by default. Treat `html_safe`, `raw`, and custom sanitizers as security-sensitive code.
- Validate file uploads by content type, extension, size, and storage destination.
- Treat background jobs, webhooks, Action Cable messages, and Turbo Stream inputs as untrusted boundaries.

Run `/security-review` for secure-by-default review patterns.
